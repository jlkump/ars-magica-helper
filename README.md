# Ars Magica Helper Application

## Overview
This project is meant to create a GUI interface that makes tracking
character information for the tabletop [Ars Magica](https://www.atlas-games.com/arsmagica/) much easier.
The goals are:
- To handle all the calculation of abilities, arts, and various formulae within the game.
- Have a season tracker within which the player can view events, both for character progression and for story beats.
- Easy to use. The user shouldn't be confused about how to do things.
- Extensibility. Should the user desire, they should be able to add their own formulae, edit existing formulae, and configure their view
